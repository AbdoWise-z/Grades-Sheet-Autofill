operating this code is simple:
	- you need to specity the "tesseract" executable path in the first cell if you are going to use OCR
	- then you just need to set the input image path in the second cell

you dont need to rerun the first cell for every image, just start from the second one if you want to change
the input image

(make sure the datasets folders are structured correctly)

Structure (tree) : 
	- digits_dataset
		-0
